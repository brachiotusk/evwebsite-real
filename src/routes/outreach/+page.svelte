    Over the past 5 years of Escape Velocity, we have built a large scale operation working to both bring FIRST and STEM to local communities but also across the globe.
      Our longest partnership has been with the nonprofit Joy of Reading. Joy of Reading is a 501c(3) nonprofit that works to donate used books and set up libraries across
      the globe to support disadvantaged kids. They have started 165+ Libraries across India, Nepal, Costa Rica and soon parts of Africa, along with this they have donated upwards of 45,000 books. We worked
      with Joy of Reading to start a library in Haryana, 2 years ago and have worked at multiple book sorting and collecting events across King County. This year, we are starting a library in Hyderabad, India,
      and helping to support the newly started computer lab at a school in Vijaywada, India. We will work with them to begin FIRST in the coming years.
